REVISION HISTORY

 See http://sourceforge.net/projects/phloem for the full revision history.

 0.0.5 Mon Sep 28 08:27:09 2009 UTC
    - Tagging the 0.0.5 release of the Phloem project.

    - Further work on the Xylem::Class mechanism. It still isn't used in the
      code, but it will be shortly.

 0.0.4 Thu Sep 24 13:40:43 2009 UTC
    - Tagging the 0.0.4 release of the Phloem project.

    - Various minor changes to the documentation.

    - Some minor bug fixes, mostly in the utility scripts/code.

    - Added a new class mechanism for Xylem. This is not yet used anywhere;
      that will probably happen for the 0.0.5 release.

 0.0.3 Wed Sep 16 11:12:18 2009 UTC
    - Tagging the 0.0.3 release of the Phloem project.

    - To hell with portability; I'd rather the code was clean. We now
      require recent versions of Archive::Tar, File::Path and Module::CoreList.

    - The Phloem library code now uses Carp throughout, to croak() where
      previously it would die(). This is just good Perl library etiquette.

 0.0.2 Tue Sep 15 07:29:32 2009 UTC
    - Tagging the 0.0.2 release of the Phloem project.

    - Some minor concessions to portability. Specifically, support older
      versions of the Archive::Tar and File::Path modules.

 0.0.1 Fri Sep 11 14:09:18 2009 UTC
    - Tagging the 0.0.1 release of the Phloem project.

 0.0.0 Thu Aug 27 13:28:27 2009 UTC
    - Initial commit of the Phloem Content Delivery Network project.
